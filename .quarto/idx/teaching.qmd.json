The course involves the scheduled seminar, as well as required\nfieldwork time at a partner high school. This course will apply\nframeworks and theories from climate communication, behavior change, and\nYouth Participatory Action Research (YPAR). Students will engage in a\nhands-on, youth-engaged research project and apply YPAR principles to\nempower youth voices and youth action in climate discourse and action.\nGraduate students will learn core theories about behavior change,\ncommunication intervention design, and YPAR. They will gain experience\ndesigning and implementing a mixed-methods study, combining qualitative\nwith quantitative research techniques to conduct formative research,\nmessage design, and testing in partnership with youth. Through this\nproject, students will develop proficiency in data analysis,\ninterpretation, and presentation of findings. The course will also cover\nethical and practical considerations in youth-centered research,\nrelationship building, community engagement strategies, and effective\nfacilitation skills.
