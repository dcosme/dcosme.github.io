::: {#hero-heading}
I'm the Scientific Director of the [Climate Communication Division of the Annenberg Public Policy Center](https://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/cc/) and a Senior Researcher in the [Communication Neuroscience Lab](https://cn.asc.upenn.edu/).

Broadly, I am interested in understanding social, cognitive, and motivational factors that promote individual and collective behavior change.

The overarching goal of my research is to use insights from neuroscience, psychology, and communication to design and evaluate translational interventions that facilitate behavior change, improve health and well-being, and promote civic participation across the lifespan.

I am particularly interested in using participatory research methods to support adolescents and emerging adults to deepen their sense of self, and gain a sense of agency, purpose, and connection to their communities.

To achieve these goals, my research combines univariate and multivariate neuroscience approaches, machine learning and computational methods, experiments, experience sampling, and field studies, as well as co-design and participatory action research.
